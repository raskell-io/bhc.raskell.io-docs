BHC supports multiple runtime profiles, each optimized for different use cases. Profiles affect code generation, runtime behavior, and available features.

Choose a profile based on your application's requirements:

- **Default** - General-purpose, compatibility-focused
- **Server** - Structured concurrency, observability hooks
- **Numeric** - Optimized for computational workloads
- **Edge** - Minimal footprint for WASM and embedded
