The **default** profile is the standard compilation mode for BHC. It focuses on correctness and GHC compatibility.

## When to Use

Use the default profile when:

- Building general-purpose applications
- Maximum GHC compatibility is required
- You don't have specific performance requirements
- Testing or prototyping

## Usage

The default profile is used automatically:

```bash
bhc Main.hs -o main
```

Or explicitly:

```bash
bhc --profile=default Main.hs -o main
```

## Characteristics

- **Evaluation**: Lazy by default (standard Haskell semantics)
- **GC**: Standard generational garbage collector
- **Concurrency**: Green threads with cooperative scheduling
- **FFI**: Full C FFI support

## Example

```haskell
module Main where

import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
    putStrLn "Sorted list:"
    print (sort numbers)

factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

Compile and run:

```bash
bhc Main.hs -o main
./main
```
